    <div class="subheading mb-3"><b>Raiyan Jahangir</b></div>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">

      Infants need constant supervision because they are vulnerable to several health problems and cannot express their needs clearly. However, it is not possible for parents to monitor their infants all the time. It is more challenging if they are working outside. Although currently, many infant monitoring systems are available, most of them lack features like detecting infant cries, an infant's primary means of communication. In such systems, automatic identification of an infant's cry is necessary because a cry is an infant's primary form of communication, and it indicates some sort of emergency. Again, many systems have infant cry detection mechanisms, however, these are not very accurate in detecting infant cries in a noisy household setting. To address these limitations, in this research, different conventional and hybrid ML models are developed and analyzed in detail to detect infant cries in a household setting. Finally, a stacked classifier is proposed using different state-of-the-art technologies, which outperforms all other developed models. The proposed CNN-SCNet's (CNN Stacked Classifier Network) precision, recall, and f1-score are found to be 98.72%, 98.05%, and 98.39%, respectively.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">

      A heart arrhythmia refers to a group of conditions characterized by irregular heartbeats. The mortality rate associated with this condition has been steadily increasing. Regular monitoring of arrhythmia is crucial for effective patient management, as early detection and appropriate treatment significantly enhance the chances of survival. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a commonly used tool to diagnose heart arrhythmias. Traditionally, ECG signals have been interpreted by cardiologists and other clinical specialists, relying on their expertise and knowledge. However, the integration of automated technology and computer-assisted approaches can greatly assist in diagnosing heart arrhythmias, streamlining the process for healthcare professionals. </p>

      Visually impaired people have previously been brought into the learning and educational systems by adopting various forms of assistive technology like the haptic feedback system. Such haptic systems generally need expensive equipment and the support of sighted teachers and are limited to teaching only a single language’s alphabet or basic grammar. Thus, the objectives of this research are to develop an approach integrating voice-over guidance to teach multilingual alphabet writing to visually impaired people and to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. As an outcome, a system was developed for teaching multilingual alphabets to visually impaired people with voice instructions. With the aid of the voice-over guide, the learners will write alphabets with a stylus on a graphics pad. The proposed system continuously checks the learner’s strokes and alerts them if they are deviating from the path of writing. An image-processing algorithm and a best-performed machine learning model were also developed to provide feedback about the learners’ progress and offer suggestions for improvement. Finally, the system’s performance and usability were evaluated through an empirical study replicated with twelve participants. The study found that the proposed system is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to end users.

      Cataract is a very common eye disease and one of the main causes of blindness, while the disease is diagnosed mostly in a manual way in most modern medical facilities. Pattern recognition is a proven and already adopted technique in medical informatics primarily to detecting tumors and another anomaly in x-ray reports, diagnosing heart failure, and the like. Thus, the application of pattern recognition can be utilized to differentiate between healthy and infected eyes by learning patterns from images, while the use of machine learning may enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the classification process. Therefore, the objective of this study is to classify between normal eyes and cataract infected eyes using several machine learning (ML) algorithms and to develop a viable web application for cataract prediction based on best-performed ML algorithm. In this research, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) with transfer learning has been used to formulate the classifier model for the detection of cataracts from the images of right and left fundus of human eyes. Evaluating the performance of the algorithms with test data, it has been shown that CNN with transfer learning has shown a better accuracy in the case of classification of cataract (97.8%) whereas SVM (71.5%) and Random Forest (68.3%) have shown moderate performance. A web application was developed with the best-performed ML model to be used by the general people, patients and health professionals. Furthermore, the application was evaluated with real-end users in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and usability. </div>

      A brain tumor is a severe neurological condition that happens because of the uncontrolled growth of cells inside the brain or skull. The number of deaths because of this condition is increasing at an abrupt rate. That is why early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors are important. If not treated timely, the brain tumors can worsen the situation and can result in death. MRI images of the brain are inspected to detect and classify brain tumors. However, such tasks are carried out by physicians manually, which takes time. Therefore, automated approaches are necessary to make this task easier. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been used to identify and classify brain tumors on MRI images. But with time, new technologies are developed which are expected to replace the existing ones. Two such state-of-the-art technologies are Big Transfer (BiT) and Vision Transformer (ViT). The use of these technologies in brain tumor classification is still scant. Therefore, this research aims to classify brain tumors with the help of these two technologies and evaluate their performances based on precision, recall, and f1-score. Finally, the results are compared, which shows that Big Transfer (BiT) performs better than Vision Transformer (ViT) for both training (100% precision, 100% recall, 100% f1-score) and test data (95.928% precision, 95.922% recall, 95.924% f1-score) in classifying brain tumors.  </div>

      A brain tumor is a deadly neurological condition that happens as a result of the abnormal growth of cells inside the brain or skull. The number of people dying of this condition is increasing sharply. Early identification and treatment of brain tumors are necessary because, if not treated timely, the condition of the tumors deteriorates, which can indeed lead to death. MRI images are inspected by physicians to identify and classify brain tumors, which takes time. Therefore, automated approaches are necessary to make easier identification and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. Machine Learning (ML) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been used to identify and classify brain tumors on MRI images. The CNN-based classifiers have already shown promising results in classifying brain tumors. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) evolved as the new alternative to CNN-based models on image classification tasks. The use of ViTs in brain tumor classification is still uncommon. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to train some ViT and CNN models on classifying brain tumors and evaluate their performances based on precision, recall, and f1-score. The results showed that both ViT and CNN-based classifiers have satisfactory performances, with ViT showing better performance on train data and CNN-based classifiers showing better performance on test data.

      Maize diseases can cause major economic losses and jeopardize food security. Maize diseases such as Gray Leaf Spot, Blast, and Common Rust have been identified globally. These diseases can be promptly managed and controlled with the help of early detection and correct identification, minimizing losses. Machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers, have been increasingly used in maize disease detection. These models have shown promising results, with high accuracy rates in identifying various types of maize diseases. Recently, vision transformers have emerged as a potential alternative to CNNs in image classification tasks, including crop disease detection. In this study, four types of Vision Transformer models (ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, ViT-L/16, and ViT-L/32) were used in addition to four types of CNN models (DenseNet121, VGG16, ResNet152V2, and InceptionV3) for maize leaf disease classification. The results showed that ViT-B/16 achieved the highest accuracy of 94.51% using the SGD optimizer, outperforming the other models.

      Potato plants are vulnerable to various leaf diseases that can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of these diseases are crucial for effective management and intervention. However, farmers' manual monitoring practices are laborious and prone to errors. Therefore, there is a need for automated approaches to efficiently and accurately detect and classify leaf diseases. In recent years, machine learning techniques and convolutional neural network (CNN) models have shown great potential in automating disease detection in agriculture. However, as technology advances, new approaches such as Big Transfer (BiT) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have emerged as state-of-the-art technologies that hold promise for disease classification tasks. Nevertheless, their application in potato leaf disease classification remains limited. To address this gap, this research aims to classify potato leaf diseases using BiT and ViT models and evaluate their performance based on precision, recall, and f1-score. The study compares the results of both types of models to determine their effectiveness in classifying potato leaf diseases. The findings reveal that BiT outperforms ViT regarding classification performance on both the training (100% precision, 100% recall, 100% f1-score) and test data (97.329% precision, 97.624% recall, 97.469% f1-score).

      Mango farming, crucial to agriculture in Bangladesh, faces severe threats from leaf diseases, notably anthracnose and powdery mildew. For diseases to be effectively managed, it must be accurately identified. This work uses a novel approach called CycleGAN-generated data augmentation to classify these diseases. Exceptional results were achieved using various models, including ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, BiT-M-R50x1, BiT-s-R50x1, VGG16, ResNet152, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and ResNet50V2, although only ViT-B/16, ViT-B/32, and BiT-M-R50x1 reached 100% accuracy. This represents a significant development in the detection of mango leaf diseases and demonstrates CycleGAN’s potential to improve model performance. The acclaimed image classification Vision Transformer models ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32 performed exceptionally well at differentiating between healthy and damaged leaves. This performance was echoed by the adaptable BiT-M-R50x1 model, demonstrating the potency of our strategy. These findings hold great promise for Bangladesh’s agriculture, potentially revolutionizing mango leaf disease management, and addressing a significant concern for the nation’s mango industry. Future research may expand this methodology to encompass more mango leaf diseases, further enhancing its relevance. This study underscores the transformative potential of advanced deep learning techniques in safeguarding agricultural yields and ensuring food security in mango-producing regions of Bangladesh.

      In recent times, Dengue fever has been causing widespread suffering among the people of Bangladesh. Despite Dengue outbreaks occurring every year, the current endemic has surpassed the records of previous years in terms of the number of deaths and hospitalizations. Dengue is mainly spread through the Aedes mosquito, which is prevalent in Bangladesh. Although many initiatives have been taken to combat and prevent the spread of Dengue fever in most households, the spread could not be controlled since the main breeding grounds of mosquitoes, the drainage systems, remain mostly unmaintained and unclean. The local authorities usually carry out the traditional fogging method at certain intervals to keep the mosquitoes under control. However, this method is manual, not very effective, and harmful to the environment and human lives. As a result, there are more risks than rewards in such methods. Therefore, this article aims to propose a conceptual framework for an automated mosquito-controlling system that can be employed in drainage systems of Bangladesh to limit mosquito breeding and prevent the spread of Dengue fever. The system is cost-effective, simple, and efficient, and the detection process of this system showed success of more than 80% on all performance parameters.

              The visually impaired people have been previously brought into the sphere of learning and education using various assistive technology, which has the latent to improve. These technologies have primarily relied on haptic feedback. Similarly, these technologies or approaches require the assistance of sighted teachers or various costly tools. Moreover, these existing systems are typically restricted to teaching the alphabet or strokes of a single language. To address these research gaps, a system is developed that teaches visually impaired people to learn the writing of the alphabet. In the proposed system, the visually impaired learners will be guided by a voice-over from a computer to write alphabets on a graphics pad using a stylus. Finally, the written alphabet can be checked through an image-processing technique to measure its accuracy. The voice-over guide constantly monitors the strokes being made by the learner, and if the learner gives any wrong strokes or move out of the guided way when writing the pad, the system provides alert and instructions accordingly. The system also very successfully informed the visually impaired learners about their learning progress or accuracy of a particular alphabet and suggested improvement, if required.

              Interactive whiteboards are used to make classroom teaching and discussion easier and are used in all levels of educational classes, corporate conference rooms, coaching studios, television studios, and the like. Interactive whiteboards need to be usable and user-friendly to the end-users having diverse backgrounds (e.g., usages familiarity with such smart systems). Thus, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the interfaces of the whiteboards to reveal their usability problems and to provide possible design guidelines to improve the usability of such embedded systems. To attain these objectives, two interactive whiteboards were evaluated through a heuristic evaluation (HE) and a user study. The HE was carried out with four experts, followed by a user study replicated with seven participants. As outcomes, the studies revealed several usability problems that are grouped into seven categories, that includes, for example, inconsistent use of icons, deep navigation, lack of accelerators, and absence of flexibility. Design guidelines were then proposed to solve the revealed problems and to improve the usability of interactive whiteboards.

              Infants must be monitored around the clock because they are at risk for various health issues and cannot communicate their needs properly. Though several infant monitoring systems exist to monitor infants, most of these do not have features like detecting infant cries, which is infants' primary form of communication. Automatic detection of an infant cry in a domestic context is essential in such systems. It is also crucial for researchers who study the relationship between infant cry patterns and various health parameters. This research proposes novel recurrent neural network architectures for the automatic detection of infant cries in a domestic context that will achieve better performance and provide a more convenient way for parents to monitor their infants. To attain these objectives, four recurrent neural network architectures were built and trained with a dataset containing recordings of infants along with various noises available in a domestic context. The models were also evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. As an outcome, the trained models were shown to achieve satisfactory performance.

              Infants must be monitored around the clock because they are at risk for various health issues (e.g., breathing difficulties and feeding problems), vulnerable, and cannot communicate their needs properly. This becomes more essential for mothers who work outside, keeping their child or infants at home or at a daycare center. Though several types of infant monitoring systems exist to monitor infants, most of these do not have all possible intelligent features like the detection of infant cries, which is the primary form of communication for infants. Again, not all research evaluated their systems to prove their validity. Therefore, this research offers a machine learning-based intelligent infant monitoring system for working mothers to monitor their infants remotely and to ensure their proper care and safety. As an outcome, this research develops a smart infant monitoring system adopting a neural network model for cry detection and conducted an evaluation study replicated with 15 participants, which showed that the proposed system could provide an easier and more convenient way for working mothers to monitor their infants.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Tools : Pytorch, OpenMM</div>
            <p>In this project, we implemented the openmm local energy minimizer (that is used to minimize the free energy of protein in protein dynamics) using pytorch. We extended the autograd mechanics of pytorch for a custom backpropagation where in the forward pass the energy is calculated and in the backward pass, each atom's coordinate is updated according to the energy gradients. This work was done under supervision of Prof. David Koes. </p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Tools : Keras library (Tensorflow Backend), Python</div>
            <p>In this term project, we did an experiment on Neural Machine Translation(NMT) for Bangla to English Translation. We used a moderate size dataset containing 4379 sentence translations from English to Bangla. We used seq2seq encoder-decoder model containing Word2Vec and LSTMs with and without attention for small epochs. With finely tuned hyperparameters, we observed that using Bahdanau's attention with the vanilla encoder-decoder model improves the BLEU score for Bangla to English translation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we developed a posture corrector android application that can detect unusual bending of the user. The application is connected with a wearable device containing Arduino and flex sensor. A user wearing a dress containing the device gets a notification in his application if he bends in a way that is harmful to his posture. Later a small physical motor was also introduced with the device that will force the user to correct his posture in case he doesn't has his phone nearby. However, the work was done for term project purpose and not commercially deployable.</p>

            <p>In this term project, a cross-platform application was developed for travelers inside Bangladesh. Using the app, anyone can easily find the popular tourist places in Bangladesh, see user reviews and available accommodations nearby the place, view the places with high risks and get suggestions on how to avoid them. The project was deployed using AngularJs framework Ionic for frontend and a Python Django server for backend; the communication between frontend and backend was established using a REST API.</p>

            <p>In this sophomore project, an application named FoodiesDhaka was developed using JavaFX and MySQL. In this application, the app users are provided with a choice of restaurants according to different areas in Dhaka city and they can see the user reviews and ratings for the restaurants. They can also suggest adding new restaurants in the list that can be further reviewed and checked by the admin side. The communication is done using Java Networking. However, the whole project was done in the localhost for term project purpose and is not deployable commercially.</p>
